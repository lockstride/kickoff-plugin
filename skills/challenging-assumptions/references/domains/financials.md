# Financials Domain Challenges

Challenge patterns for scrutinizing business plans, pitch decks, and financial projections.

## Common Weak Spots

- **Hockey stick projections** — Exponential growth without justification
- **Magic unit economics** — LTV/CAC ratios that seem too good
- **Assumption cascades** — Small errors that compound into large ones
- **Funding dependency** — Business that only works with continuous capital
- **Margin erosion** — Ignoring pricing pressure over time

## Challenge Templates

### Challenge: Revenue Assumptions

> Your projections show $[X]M revenue in year 3. Walk me through the math. How many customers, at what ACV, with what close rate, from what pipeline? Where does any of this come from?

**Why it matters:** Projections are only credible if the underlying mechanics are plausible.

**Satisfactory response:** Breaks down revenue into component parts with reasonable assumptions for each (customers × price × close rate × pipeline).

### Challenge: Unit Economics

> What's your CAC? What's your LTV? What's the ratio? If you don't know, how are you planning to spend on growth?

**Why it matters:** LTV/CAC determines whether growth is profitable or a money-burning treadmill.

**Satisfactory response:** Provides specific numbers with methodology. If early-stage, acknowledges uncertainty but shows how they'll measure and target.

### Challenge: Path to Profitability

> Your plan shows losses for the first 4 years. When do you become profitable, and what has to happen to get there? What if fundraising becomes difficult?

**Why it matters:** Investors want to see a path to sustainability, not permanent dependency on external capital.

**Satisfactory response:** Identifies specific milestones (revenue level, margin improvement, customer count) that lead to profitability.

### Challenge: Assumption Sensitivity

> Your projections depend on [key assumption]. What happens if that assumption is off by 50%? Does the business still work?

**Why it matters:** Single-point forecasts hide risk. Sensitivity analysis reveals fragility.

**Satisfactory response:** Acknowledges the dependency and either shows the business works at 50% or identifies a mitigation plan.

### Challenge: Fundraising Strategy

> You're raising $[X]M at a $[Y]M valuation. What milestones will this capital achieve? What valuation do you need for the next round, and is that realistic given the milestones?

**Why it matters:** Many founders raise without a clear milestone plan, then struggle to justify the next round.

**Satisfactory response:** Identifies specific milestones (revenue, customer count, product launch) and connects them to valuation expectations.

### Challenge: Burn Rate

> At your current burn rate of $[X]/month, you have [N] months of runway. What happens if the next round takes 12 months instead of 6? Do you have a Plan B?

**Why it matters:** Fundraising timelines are unpredictable. Companies die when they run out of money.

**Satisfactory response:** Shows awareness of runway, identifies cost-cutting options, or explains how to extend runway without raising.

## Failure Mode Patterns

| Pattern | Red Flag | What Fails |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Hockey Stick | "Then we grow 10x in year 3" | No mechanism for growth |
| Infinite LTV | "Customers stay forever" | Churn kills projections |
| Zero CAC | "We'll grow organically" | Reality costs money |
| Round Numbers | "$1M ARR, $10M ARR, $100M ARR" | No actual math done |

## Example Exchange

**Weak Response:**

> **Challenge:** What's your CAC?
>
> "We're not sure yet, we're focused on product."

*Early-stage startups can still estimate. This shows lack of financial rigor.*

**Strong Response:**

> **Challenge:** What's your CAC?
>
> "Based on our first 8 customers, we spent about $12K in founder time and $2K in marketing to acquire them. That's $1,750 per customer. We expect CAC to increase as we exhaust founder networks, so we're modeling $3K for the next 50 customers. Our target LTV is $15K based on 24-month retention and $625/month ACV, giving us a 5:1 ratio at scale. We need to prove that retention assumption."

*Honest about current state, realistic about future challenges, shows the math.*
