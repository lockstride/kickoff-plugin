## 8. AI Impact Assessment

<!-- Guidance: Evaluate how current and foreseeable AI advancements affect this business — both positively and negatively. This is a critical lens for early-stage viability. Businesses that structurally benefit from AI improvements over time are strongly favored. Businesses whose core value proposition erodes as AI advances — especially "AI wrapper" businesses — face existential risk and must be scrutinized hard. Be direct and honest; this section should materially influence the SWOT and strategic recommendations that follow. -->

### AI Tailwinds — How AI Advances Benefit This Business

<!-- Guidance: Identify specific ways improving AI capabilities make this business stronger, cheaper to operate, or more valuable over time. Consider: Does AI reduce COGS? Expand addressable market? Create compounding data advantages? Enable capabilities that weren't previously possible? Favor businesses where AI is an accelerant to a durable value proposition, not the value proposition itself. -->

{AI_TAILWINDS_ANALYSIS}

### AI Headwinds — How AI Advances Threaten This Business

<!-- Guidance: Identify specific ways improving AI capabilities could undermine this business. Consider: Could a foundation model provider offer this natively? Does the product's value shrink as AI gets cheaper/better? Is the core differentiation a thin integration layer over an LLM? Could customers replicate this with prompts or agents? Be especially harsh on businesses that are essentially packaging commodity AI capabilities with a UI — these face margin compression and disintermediation as AI platforms improve. -->

{AI_HEADWINDS_ANALYSIS}

### AI Resilience Verdict

<!-- Guidance: Deliver a clear, honest verdict. Classify the business into one of these categories and justify:
- **AI-Native Advantage**: AI improvements compound the business's value (e.g., proprietary data flywheels, domain-specific models, AI-enabled workflows that create lock-in).
- **AI-Assisted**: AI is a useful tool but not the core value prop. Business is largely neutral to AI advances (e.g., AI speeds up internal operations but the product value is elsewhere).
- **AI-Exposed**: Core value proposition is at moderate risk from AI advances. Differentiation depends on execution speed and feature depth vs. improving general-purpose AI.
- **AI-Wrapper Risk**: Business is primarily packaging commodity AI with limited defensibility. As AI platforms improve, the value of the wrapper layer compresses. This is a serious red flag.

Be direct. If this is a wrapper business, say so. If the moat is "we fine-tuned a model" or "we built a nice UI on top of GPT," that's not durable differentiation. -->

## 9. SWOT Analysis — {STARTUP_NAME}

<!-- Guidance: Be honest and specific. Avoid generic statements. Each item should be grounded in evidence from this analysis — including the AI Impact Assessment.

<!-- Guidance: True, defensible advantages — not aspirational qualities. -->

{STRENGTHS_LIST}

### Weaknesses (Internal, Negative)
