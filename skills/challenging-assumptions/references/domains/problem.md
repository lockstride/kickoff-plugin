# Problem Domain Challenges

Challenge patterns for scrutinizing problem validation in business briefs and early-stage ideation artifacts.

## Common Weak Spots

- **"Everyone has this problem"** — Too broad; no specific ICP
- **Nice-to-have disguised as must-have** — Low urgency, no budget
- **Founder projection** — Assuming others feel pain founder feels
- **Solution in search of problem** — Technology-first thinking
- **Unvalidated assumptions** — No customer interviews cited

## Challenge Templates

### Challenge: Problem Specificity

> Your problem statement is broad. "Businesses waste time on X" could describe millions of companies. Who SPECIFICALLY feels this pain daily, and how do you know?

**Why it matters:** Broad problems attract broad competition and diffuse positioning. Specificity enables wedge strategies.

**Satisfactory response:** Names a specific segment with evidence (interviews, data, personal experience in the industry).

### Challenge: Urgency and Budget

> Is this problem painful enough that your target customer will STOP what they're doing, find budget, navigate procurement, and implement a new solution? What evidence supports that?

**Why it matters:** Most "problems" are tolerable inconveniences. Real problems have active buyers, not passive sufferers.

**Satisfactory response:** Points to existing budget allocation, recent purchases of alternatives, or documented failed internal attempts to solve.

### Challenge: Why Now

> This problem has existed for years. Why is NOW the right time to solve it? What changed?

**Why it matters:** "Why now" is one of the most common investor questions. Founders without a good answer often struggle to explain timing advantages.

**Satisfactory response:** Cites a specific catalyst (technology shift, regulatory change, market event, cost curve crossing).

### Challenge: Competitive Reality

> How do people solve this today? If the answer is "they don't," why not — is the problem not painful enough?

**Why it matters:** Absence of solutions often indicates absence of budget or urgency, not an open market.

**Satisfactory response:** Describes specific workarounds, internal tools, or spreadsheet solutions with their limitations.

### Challenge: Founder-Market Fit

> What gives YOU the right to solve this problem? What unique insight or access do you have that others don't?

**Why it matters:** Great markets attract many entrants. Founder-market fit is a sustainable advantage.

**Satisfactory response:** Demonstrates domain expertise, unique access to customers, or proprietary insight from experience.

## Failure Mode Patterns

| Pattern | Red Flag | What Fails |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Vitamin vs. Painkiller | "Users will love this" | No one pays for vitamins |
| Missionary vs. Mercenary | "We'll educate the market" | Education is expensive; incumbents copy |
| Imagined Customer | "I'm sure they'd pay for this" | No validated demand |
| Founder Bubble | "Everyone I know has this problem" | Selection bias in network |

## Example Exchange

**Weak Response:**

> **Challenge:** Who specifically feels this pain?
>
> "All small businesses. There are 30 million of them in the US."

*This is too broad. 30 million is not a target market, it's a census category.*

**Strong Response:**

> **Challenge:** Who specifically feels this pain?
>
> "Series A-C SaaS companies with 50-200 employees who just hired their first RevOps person. We've interviewed 12 of them, and 9 said they're actively evaluating solutions. The trigger is usually when they hit $5M ARR and their CRM becomes unmanageable."

*Specific segment, evidence of validation, clear trigger event.*
