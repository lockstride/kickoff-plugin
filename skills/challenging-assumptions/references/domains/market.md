# Market Domain Challenges

Challenge patterns for scrutinizing market analysis, competitive positioning, and go-to-market strategies.

## Common Weak Spots

- **TAM fantasy** — Unrealistic market sizing with top-down magic
- **Competitor blindness** — Ignoring or underestimating competition
- **Timing assumption** — "Now is the right time" without evidence
- **Wedge confusion** — No clear entry point into the market
- **Segment sprawl** — Targeting everyone means targeting no one

## Challenge Templates

### Challenge: TAM Methodology

> Your TAM of $[X]B is a big number. How did you calculate it? If you used top-down (industry reports), have you validated with bottom-up (actual customer count × price)?

**Why it matters:** Top-down TAM is often inflated. Investors want to see bottom-up validation.

**Satisfactory response:** Shows both top-down and bottom-up calculations, or explains why only one is appropriate with clear methodology.

### Challenge: Serviceable Market

> TAM is interesting but SAM matters more. Of your total market, what percentage can you actually reach and serve with your current product and go-to-market capabilities?

**Why it matters:** A $10B TAM means nothing if your SAM is $10M because of geographic, technical, or channel limitations.

**Satisfactory response:** Provides SAM with clear filtering criteria (geography, company size, tech stack requirements).

### Challenge: Competitive Response

> You've identified [Competitor] as your main competition. They have more resources, existing customers, and brand. What happens when they copy your best features? What's your response?

**Why it matters:** Incumbents rarely ignore successful challengers. The competitive response is inevitable.

**Satisfactory response:** Either identifies structural advantages incumbents can't replicate (focus, speed, business model) or acknowledges and plans for the competitive response.

### Challenge: Customer Acquisition

> How do you get your first 100 customers? Your first 1,000? These likely require different strategies. What's the plan for each stage?

**Why it matters:** Many startups conflate early (founder-led sales) and scale (repeatable acquisition) strategies.

**Satisfactory response:** Differentiates early-stage tactics (direct outreach, network, partnerships) from scale tactics (content, paid, channel).

### Challenge: Why This Wedge

> You're entering a market with established players. What's your wedge — the specific use case or segment where you can win first before expanding?

**Why it matters:** Attacking a market broadly invites competition from all directions. Wedge strategies create beachheads.

**Satisfactory response:** Identifies a specific underserved segment or use case and explains why incumbents can't or won't address it.

### Challenge: Timing Evidence

> You say "now is the right time" for this market. What specifically changed in the last 12-24 months that makes this true? If nothing changed, why didn't someone succeed with this already?

**Why it matters:** "Why now" is essential for investor pitches and for understanding market dynamics.

**Satisfactory response:** Points to a specific catalyst — technology cost curve, regulation, buyer behavior shift, or platform change.

## Failure Mode Patterns

| Pattern | Red Flag | What Fails |
|---------|----------|------------|
| TAM Inflation | "$50B opportunity" with no source | Credibility dies in diligence |
| Competitor Dismissal | "They're not really competitors" | Blindsided when they respond |
| Everyone Problem | "Our target is all businesses" | No positioning, no wedge |
| Category Creation | "We're creating a new category" | Expensive education, incumbents copy |

## Example Exchange

**Weak Response:**

> **Challenge:** How did you calculate your TAM?
>
> "We used the Gartner report that says the market is $15B."

*Top-down only, no validation. Gartner markets rarely map to startup opportunities.*

**Strong Response:**

> **Challenge:** How did you calculate your TAM?
>
> "Top-down, Gartner says the broader category is $15B, but that includes segments we don't address. Bottom-up: 200,000 target companies in the US (from LinkedIn data), 30% fit our ICP (60,000), average contract value of $24K based on 5 early customers. That's $1.4B SAM. We think we can capture 5% in 5 years for a $70M SOM. We're raising for the SOM, not the TAM."

*Triangulated methodology, realistic segmentation, intellectually honest.*
