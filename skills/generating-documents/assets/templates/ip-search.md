# Patentability & Freedom-to-Operate Analysis — {STARTUP_NAME}

<!-- Guidance: This document provides a comprehensive prior art search and freedom-to-operate (FTO) assessment. Target length: 2,000-3,000 words (~5-8 pages). It is structured as a patent attorney-style memo suitable for high-stakes decisions around IP strategy, product development, and investment. Focus on USPTO patents and published applications, plus relevant non-patent literature. Be thorough, cite sources, and clearly distinguish between patentability and FTO conclusions. -->

---

## 1. Executive Summary

<!-- Guidance: Provide a plain-English summary of patentability outlook (novelty + non-obviousness) and FTO risk outlook (low/med/high with rationale). Highlight key "red flag" areas and the most defensible claim themes. This section should be readable by non-patent-professionals. -->
