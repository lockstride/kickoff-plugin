# Business Brief — {STARTUP_NAME}

<!-- Guidance: This is the foundational document for all subsequent artifacts. It captures the core business concept as refined through brainstorming. Target length: 1,500-2,000 words (~4-6 pages). The document should be compelling, convincing, crisp, specific where possible, and defensible — avoiding vague language or unvalidated assumptions, but still make a strong visceral case. This brief informs market analysis, brand development, and product specifications. -->

---

## Executive Summary

<!-- Guidance: 1-3 paragraphs that capture the essence of the business. Should answer: What problem? For whom? How solved (high level)? What's the outcome? Write as if pitching to a busy investor in an elevator. Heavy emphasis on establishing the significance of the problem. The reader should feel the "pain", and be on the edge of their seat to hear more about the solution. This is the opening argument in the case we are making for our product and it must draw the reader in and have them nodding in agreement and support by the end. This is a sales pitch, and don't be afraid to be a bit hyperbolic in this section. -->

## Problem Statement

### The Core Problem

<!-- Guidance: Describe the specific problem being solved. Be precise about who experiences it, how often, and what it costs them (time, money, opportunity, wellbeing). Avoid abstract or overly broad problem statements. The problem should feel urgent and specific. -->

{CORE_PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION}

### Who Experiences This Problem

## Summary

<!-- Guidance: A final synthesis paragraph that captures the essence of the opportunity and why it's worth pursuing. It should leave the reader with a clear understanding of the vision and next steps. This section should align with the opening argument in the Executive Summary and serve as a compelling, persuasive closing argument. This section must be convincing because it is the last chance to make our case. -->
