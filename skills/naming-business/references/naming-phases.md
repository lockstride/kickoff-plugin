# Naming Exercise Phases

Detailed reference for the structured naming exercise phases. This file is loaded when conducting a full naming exercise.

---

## Core Identity

- Provocative but supportive — push hard on weak names, celebrate strong ones
- Sound-conscious — names must be easy to say, spell, and remember when heard
- Domain-aware — early rounds are feedback-only (no availability checks); from Phase 3 onward, never present a name without verified domain availability
- Strategic — connect naming to positioning and brand personality
- Persistent — maintain session state for iterative exploration

---

## Sonic Philosophy

A great name isn't just read—it's spoken. Before any name reaches a shortlist, it must pass sonic scrutiny:

- **Say it out loud.** Does it flow naturally? Or do you stumble?
- **The phone test.** Can someone understand it over a bad connection?
- **The spelling test.** After hearing it once, can a stranger spell it correctly?
- **The recall test.** If heard once at a party, would they remember it tomorrow?
- **The yell test.** Can you imagine shouting it across a conference floor with dignity?

**Sound Symbolism Awareness:**
Certain sounds carry inherent psychological associations:
- Hard consonants (K, T, P, B) → precision, power, confidence
- Soft consonants (L, M, N) → comfort, warmth, approachability
- Vowel-heavy names → openness, friendliness
- Short, punchy names → energy, memorability
- Flowing multi-syllable names → sophistication, gravitas

**Multi-Word Harmony:**
When a name contains multiple words, they must work together seamlessly:
- Same register (don't mix formal with casual)
- Complementary sounds (avoid awkward consonant clusters at word boundaries)
- Unified vibe and theme (words should feel like they belong together)
- Rhythmic balance (stressed syllables should create a natural cadence)
- Alliteration is a bonus (Coca-Cola, PayPal, Best Buy) but not forced

## Tagline Pivot Strategy

Sometimes naming gets stuck. When it does, pivoting to tagline work can unlock flow:

- A tagline forces clarity on *what you actually do*
- It surfaces the core value proposition in plain language
- Often, the name is hiding inside the tagline
- The rhythm and words of a good tagline can inspire name candidates

**When to suggest the pivot:**
- 3+ rounds of candidates with no strong reactions
- Founder keeps saying "none of these feel right" without clear direction
- Conversation is circular—revisiting the same concerns
- Energy is dropping; responses are getting shorter

**How to offer it:**
"We've been at this for a bit and nothing's clicking yet. Sometimes it helps to step back from the name and work on the tagline first. A good tagline often reveals what the name should *feel* like—or even contains it directly. Want to try that approach for a few minutes?"

---

## When to Change Direction

### Abandon a Theme

When 2+ rounds produce consistently weak results for a theme, move on. Some themes sound promising but generate poor names in practice. Say so directly and pivot.

### Be Honest About the Landscape

When every strong word in a category is taken, say so directly and offer the strategic choice:
- Accept variant domains (get-, use-, try-)
- Accept slight word modification (-ify, -ly, -era)
- Reconsider the current name as the winner

### Know When the Current Name Wins

The exercise sometimes proves the existing name is the best option. That's a valid and valuable outcome — say so clearly rather than forcing a change.

---

## Phase 1: Preference Gathering

### Load Existing Context

Before asking any questions, read `{internalPath}/business-brief.md` if it exists. Extract:
- What the product does, who it's for, and the core outcome it delivers
- Current name (becomes the baseline)
- Positioning, brand personality, and target market

This context informs every preference question and prevents asking the founder to repeat what's already documented. If no business brief exists, gather this context conversationally before proceeding.

Use AskUserQuestion for each preference area. Be provocative — these questions should make founders think deeply.

### Baseline

If a name already exists (from the business brief or config), name it explicitly and treat it as the bar to beat. Every candidate is measured against it. The exercise sometimes proves the existing name is the best option — that's a valid and valuable outcome.

### Emotional Themes

Anchor to themes, not features. Choose 4–6 emotional themes (e.g., confident, collaborative, fun, resolution). These filter weak candidates faster than any rule.

- Feelings to evoke: "What should people feel when they hear your name?"
- Feelings to avoid: "What feelings would be off-brand?"

### Style Preferences
- Fanciful vs. Descriptive: "Do you want something invented (like Spotify) or descriptive (like PayPal)?"
- Single word vs. Compound: "One word or two?"
- Abstract vs. Concrete: "Abstract concept or concrete image?"

### Imagery & Metaphors
- Visual associations: "What images should it conjure?"
- Metaphor domains: "What worlds or concepts does it relate to?"

### Sonic Profile
- Syllable limit: recommend 3 max
- Sound preference: hard/precise vs. soft/warm
- Rhythm notes: any preferences on stress patterns
- Alliteration interest: Yes/No/Neutral

### Constraints
- TLD flexibility: .com only? .ai acceptable? Variant domains (get-, use-, try-) ok?
- Conflict tolerance: same industry only, or zero conflicts in any industry?
- Industry conventions: notes on what's expected or avoided
- Geographic/cultural considerations: markets to consider
- Languages to screen: relevant markets (default: Spanish, French, Mandarin)

**→ ALIGNMENT CHECKPOINT**: Before proceeding to generation, summarize ALL gathered preferences — including baseline name, emotional themes, and constraints — and get confirmation.

---

## Name Construction Paths

Use these paths to guide candidate generation. Not every path suits every exercise — choose based on Phase 1 preferences.

### Path A: Real Word, Abstract Usage
*Like Stripe, Slack, Notion, Linear, Summit, Anchor*

Pick a real dictionary word with rich connotations and use it in a surprising, non-literal context. The word's existing meaning becomes subtext, not description.

- **Vetting**: Zero conflicts from established brands in any industry — not just the founder's.
- **Reality check**: The single-word space is nearly exhausted. Expect many rejections.

### Path B: Real Word + Variant Domain
*Like usename.ai, getname.com, tryname.io*

A strong brand name stands alone; the domain is a practical variant. Common prefixes: `use-`, `get-`, `try-`, `with-`. The variant should feel invisible — the name is what people remember.

- **Vetting**: Same as Path A for the word itself; check variant domain availability separately.

### Path C: Compound Real Words
*Like Basecamp, Dropbox, Mailchimp, Sunstone*

Two real words fused into one. Both words should contribute meaning; avoid random combinations. Watch for existing brands using the exact compound — very common.

- **Vetting**: Search the compound as one word, not each word separately.

### Path D: Modified Real Word
*Like Shopify (shop), Spotify (spot), Canva (canvas)*

Start with a real word, apply a suffix or slight transformation. Common patterns: `-ify`, `-ly`, `-io`, `-era`, `-ova`. Must sound natural, not forced.

- **Vetting**: The modified form must have zero conflicts — the real word's conflicts don't carry over, but the invented form might already exist.

### Path E: Creative TLD as Meaning
*Like del.icio.us, fish.net*

The domain IS the brand statement. The TLD becomes part of the word or phrase.

- **Critical rule**: Only use TLDs with verifiable RDAP servers — treat UNKNOWN availability as unavailable.
- **Reality check**: The best options (.com, .ai, .io) are exhausted; creative TLDs (.to, .is, .at) often can't be verified.

---

## Phase 2: Candidate Generation (Feedback Rounds)

Generate up to 5 candidates per round, drawn from the construction paths above. Quality over volume — each name must have a clear rationale tied to the emotional themes and preferences from Phase 1.

For each candidate, explain why it fits preferences and assess sonic quality.

**These are feedback-only rounds.** Domain availability is NOT checked yet. Frame this explicitly:

> "These names are for direction-finding, not final picks. Some may already be registered — that's fine for now. Tell me which ones resonate and which fall flat, and we'll refine from there."

The goal is creative breadth and preference calibration. Don't let availability constrain ideation at this stage. Names that get positive reactions move to Phase 3 for availability validation.

---

## Phase 2.5: Tagline Pivot (Optional)

Trigger when naming feels stuck. Work on taglines to surface the core value proposition, then mine taglines for naming inspiration.

---

## Phase 3: Availability & Risk Validation

**Gate rule: No name advances past this phase without a domain check.**

For names receiving positive reaction, run every candidate through this pipeline — in this order. Domain check first because it's fast. Web search second because it's deeper. Present only survivors.

### Step 1: Domain Check (fast, eliminates most candidates)

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/naming-business/scripts/check-domain.mjs" --domain "example.com"
```

Checks the target domain plus `.com`, `.net`, `.io`, `.ai`, `.co` variants using hybrid DNS + RDAP resolution. Accepts a name without a TLD (e.g., `--domain "example"`) to check all standard TLDs.

**Status meanings:**
- `REGISTERED` — Active DNS records (domain in use)
- `REGISTERED (inactive)` — No DNS records but registered (parked/held)
- `AVAILABLE` — Not registered, can be acquired
- `UNKNOWN` — Could not determine status; **treat as unavailable**

**Interpreting results for candidate assessment:**
- **All TLDs available** — Strong signal. Name is wide open for brand protection.
- **Target TLD available, some others taken** — Viable, but note which TLDs are taken and whether they pose confusion risk.
- **Target TLD taken, alternatives available** — Suggest pivoting to an available TLD or adjusting the name.
- **Most/all TLDs taken** — Name is crowded. Risk of brand confusion. Consider this a strike against the candidate.
- **Inactive registrations** — Domain is held but not actively used. Could potentially be acquired, but adds cost and uncertainty.

Record the full multi-TLD results in the session file Domain column (e.g., ".com ✓ .net ✗ .io ✓ .ai ✓ .co ✓").

### Step 2: Web Presence Search (deeper, catches what domain checks miss)

Only run for candidates that survive the domain check. Run two web searches:

1. **"[name]" + industry** (e.g., `"Clarifi" consulting`) — catches existing brands in the same or adjacent space
2. **"[name]" brand** (e.g., `"Clarifi" brand`) — catches funded startups, products, social presence

**What to look for:**
- **Existing businesses** using the same or very similar name, especially in adjacent industries
- **Active websites** at the domain (even if RDAP says inactive — the site may have recently launched)
- **Social media presence** under that name
- **Dictionary/common word usage** that could make SEO difficult
- **Negative associations** — scandals, defunct companies, unfortunate meanings in other contexts

**Interpreting results:**
- **No meaningful results** — Strong signal. The name has a clear field.
- **Results in unrelated industries** — Likely fine, but note for trademark analysis.
- **Results in the same or adjacent industry** — Significant risk. Flag prominently.
- **Dominant existing brand** — Name is effectively taken regardless of domain availability. Consider a strike.

Summarize findings briefly in the session file (e.g., "Web: clean, no competing brands" or "Web: existing consulting firm — high conflict risk").

### Step 3: Present Only Survivors

Never show unvetted candidates. Only names that pass both domain check and web presence search advance to the user.

### Other Validations
- Social handles availability
- Trademark search (USPTO, relevant jurisdictions)
- Linguistic/cultural screening
- SEO assessment

---

## Phase 4: Refinement & Feedback

**Gate rule: Every name presented in this phase MUST have a completed domain check. Never present an unchecked name as a viable candidate.**

If generating new candidates during refinement (e.g., variations or pivots based on feedback), run the domain check BEFORE presenting them. Drop or flag any name where the target TLD is unavailable before the user sees it.

For shortlisted candidates, challenge rigorously with stress tests:

### Strategic Tests
- Does it support the positioning?
- Will it scale with the business?
- Does it differentiate from competitors?

### Sonic Tests
- Phone test: "Hi, I'm calling from [NAME]" — does it sound natural?
- Spelling test: Can a stranger spell it after hearing once?
- Recall test: Would they remember it tomorrow?
- Yell test: Can you shout it across a conference floor with dignity?

### Memory Tests
- Distinctiveness: Will it stick?
- Confusion risk: Similar to existing brands?

### Evolution Tests
- Aging: Will it feel dated in 5 years?
- Extension: Can it support product lines?

## Phase 5: Selection & Migration

**Gate rule: Every name in the final table MUST have verified domain availability. No exceptions.**

Present final shortlist side-by-side with comprehensive assessment:

| Criterion | Candidate 1 | Candidate 2 | Candidate 3 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Sonic Score | X/5 | X/5 | X/5 |
| Domain (.com) | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ |
| Domain (other TLDs) | X/5 avail | X/5 avail | X/5 avail |
| Web Presence | clean/conflict | clean/conflict | clean/conflict |
| TM Risk | L/M/H | L/M/H | L/M/H |
| Social | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ |
| Strategic Fit | X/5 | X/5 | X/5 |

If selected, offer to:
1. Update all documents with new name
2. Rename project folder
3. Update config profile

```

---

## Shortlisting Criteria

A name earns the shortlist only when it passes **all** of:

- Viable domain path confirmed (exact or strong variant)
- Zero brand conflicts in the founder's industry (or any industry, per Phase 1 conflict tolerance)
- Passes all four sonic tests (phone, spelling, recall, yell)
- Meaningfully better than the baseline name
- No negative connotations in target languages

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Never present a name before vetting it.** No exceptions. Phase 2 is explicitly labeled as feedback-only exploration; from Phase 3 onward, every name must be fully vetted before the user sees it.
2. **Never treat UNKNOWN domain status as available.**
3. **Invented words must have zero prior use** — not just in the same industry.
4. **Don't present more than 5 candidates per round.** Quality over volume.
5. **Never present a name without rationale** tied to the emotional themes and preferences.

---

## Quality Standards

- Phase 2 names are feedback-only — clearly label them as such, no domain checks required
- Phase 3+ names MUST have completed domain check AND web presence search before being presented
- Update session file after each phase
- Challenge weak names directly
- Celebrate strong names
- Respect the user's time — check in periodically
- Prevent regression — keep rejected names in the table
